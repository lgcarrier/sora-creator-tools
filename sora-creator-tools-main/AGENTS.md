# AGENTS.md

## Purpose

- Define repository-specific instructions for coding agents.
- Keep guidance concrete: exact commands, paths, and constraints.
- Keep this file current when commands or conventions change.

## Repository Snapshot

- Project: `sora-creator-tools`
- Primary stack: `Chrome Extension (Manifest V3) + vanilla JavaScript + Node.js built-in test runner`
- Key entry points: `manifest.json`, `content.js`, `inject.js`, `dashboard.js`, `background.js`

## Commands

- Install dependencies (tooling only): `node --version && npm --version`
- Start development environment:
  - `open -a "Google Chrome" "chrome://extensions"`
  - In Chrome, enable Developer mode and Load unpacked from `/sora-creator-tools`
- Build production artifact (release zip): `rm -f release.zip && zip -r release.zip manifest.json *.js *.html *.css icons imagery -x "*.DS_Store"`
- Run tests: `node --test tests/*.test.js`
- Run JavaScript syntax checks: `for f in *.js tests/*.js; do node --check "$f"; done`
- Run whitespace/error check before commit: `git diff --check`

## Workflow Rules

- Read this file before making edits.
- Keep changes scoped to the user request; avoid opportunistic refactors.
- Do not change extension permissions, host matches, or injected network hooks unless requested.
- Preserve local-first behavior: do not add new external network calls. Existing network activity must remain limited to the current Sora/OpenAI endpoints already used by the project.
- Ask before destructive actions (mass deletes, history rewrites, resets).
- Run relevant verification commands before finalizing changes.

## Pull Request Expectations

- Summarize behavior changes and impacted files.
- Include verification commands run and key outcomes.
- Include screenshots or short recordings for dashboard/UI changes.
- Call out known risks, assumptions, or follow-up work.

## Monorepo Notes

- This repository is not a monorepo.
- Add nested `AGENTS.md` files only if a subdirectory later needs different rules.
