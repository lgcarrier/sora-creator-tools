## Repository basics

This project is a Chrome extension (Manifest V3) using vanilla JavaScript.

Key files:
- `manifest.json`
- `content.js`
- `inject.js`
- `background.js`
- `dashboard.js`

## Development setup

Prerequisites (tooling only):

```bash
node --version && npm --version
```

Load unpacked extension in Chrome:
1. Open `chrome://extensions`
2. Enable **Developer mode**
3. Click **Load unpacked**
4. Select this repository folder

## Local validation before PR

Run these commands before opening a PR:

```bash
node --test tests/*.test.js
for f in *.js tests/*.js; do node --check "$f"; done
git diff --check
```

Optional release artifact build:

```bash
rm -f release.zip && zip -r release.zip manifest.json *.js *.html *.css icons imagery -x "*.DS_Store"
```

## Scope and expectations

- Keep changes scoped to the issue/request; avoid opportunistic refactors.
- Do not broaden extension permissions, host matches, or injected network hooks unless explicitly required.
- Preserve local-first behavior. Do not add new external network calls; keep network activity limited to the current Sora/OpenAI endpoints already used by the project.
- Document any new setup/test steps in README if workflow changes.

## Pull request checklist

Include the following in your PR:
- Clear summary of behavior changes
- List of impacted files
- Validation commands run and key outcomes
- Screenshots or short recordings for dashboard/UI changes
- Known risks, assumptions, or follow-up work
